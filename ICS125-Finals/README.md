## Enterprise Architecture
Conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of technology in an organization.

### Enterprise
-  can be a government agency, a whole corporation, a division of a corporation, a single department, or a chain of geographically distant organizations linked together by common ownership.

### Architecture 
- fundamental organization of asystem, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.

### Advantages from good EA
1. **More efficient** IT operation
2. **Better return on existing investment**, reduced risk for future investment
3. **Faster**, **simpler**, and **cheaper** procurement

### Goal of EA
- Create a unified IT environment across the firm or all of the firm's business units, with tight symbiotic links to the business side of the organization and its strategy.
- Promote alignment, standardization, reuse of existing IT assets, and the sharing of common methods for project management and software development across the organization.

### Purpose of EA (B.I.A.I)

## IT Outsourcing

### Outsourcing
Used by different companies to reduce costs by transferring portions of work to outside suppliers rather than completing it internally.

#### Procurement
- finding, agreeing terms and acquiring goods, services or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive bidding process

#### Purchasing 
- subset of procurement. Purchasing generally refers simply to buying goods or services. Purchasing often includes receiving and payment as well.

### BPO
- Information Technology enabled Services (ITES)
- categorized into back office outsourcing, which includes internal business functions such as human
resources or finance and accounting, and front
office outsourcing, which includes customer-related services such as contact centre services

### Global Service Provider
- Connects firms to different outsourcing businesses in an international level
- **Offshore**
    - outsourcing around the world.Usually Westerners do this because of cheaper labor and better skills from Asia. Problem could be time difference.
- **Nearshore**
    -  outsourcing near the country. Problem could be different cultures.

### Outsourced Services
- **Techonology Services**
    - Companies requires advanced IT and communication technologies for their regular operations. Rapid changes in the technology sector bring new capabilities to use for companies that need to select the right kind of vendor to get the best technology at the cheapest cost. 
- **Business Processes**
    - Various business processes are not core to a company’s main line of business. Companies outsource such processes and focus on their core competence.

### Why Outsource?
- Company needs a highly- skilled IT staff, but can't afford to have one.
- Doesn't have budget allocated in its IT services.
- Would benefit from the latest technology, but doesn't have the expertise to deploy.

### PROS vs. CONS
- **PROS**
    - Cost effective
    - Increased Productivity
    - Access to World class Solutions
    - Better people management
    - Focus on core competencies
- **CONS**
    - Loss of managerial control
    - Hidden Cost
    - Threat to security
    - Lose talent inside company
    - Selection to supplier
    - Dependent on service provider

## World Wide Web
